Let us see what are the different types of communication that we can conceive among processes.

Functionally, the communication can be of following types.

    Communication through common variables: That is, 2 or more processes will have common variables. Value assigned to such a common variable by a process can be read/altered  by other processes.
    One process produces  data and another consumes it.
    Processes use the same file
    Transfer of messages
    One Process sends a Signal to another process
    Synchronization of execution of one process from within another process. That is, from within a process to control which part of another process can (or cannot) execute and when.
